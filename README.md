## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

### What was your motivation?
The driving force behind building this project was the main recognition role in shaping my professional identity. Beyond being a homework assignment, my motivation was to establish a compelling online portfolio that goes beyond a mere display of skills.

### Why did you build this project?
I built this project to establish a strong online presence and create a compelling portfolio that goes beyond a simple display of technical skills. The motivation behind it was not merely to fulfill a homework assignment but to craft a platform that reflects your personality, showcases your projects, and serves as a valuable tool in your job search. 

### What problem does it solve?
This portfolio page addresses the challenge of presenting snapshot of who I am as a developer. It solves the problem of potential employers needing a centralized location to evaluate my skills, explore my work, and easily access relevant information.

### What did you learn?
Building this project taught me more than just technical skills; it provided insights into the art of creating a meaningful user experience. I gained proficiency in using flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to craft a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices. The process of linking sections for easy navigation and ensuring a larger display for the first application image enhanced my understanding of design.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
